Solving 200-300 good Leetcode problems will only help you clear 50% of the rounds. You still have to master system design basics. 

I struggled a lot until I sat down and focused deeply on the basics. Start with these 11 basic & essential concepts:

1. Scalability
- Ensures systems can handle increased load and grow efficiently.

2. Latency vs Throughput
- Balances speed and capacity in system performance.

3. CAP Theorem
- Explains the trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in distributed systems.

4. ACID Transactions
- Guarantees reliable database processing through atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability.

5. Rate Limiting
- Controls the amount of incoming and outgoing traffic to prevent overload and abuse.

6. API Design
- Ensures APIs are user-friendly, efficient, and maintainable.

7. Strong vs Eventual Consistency
- Balances the need for immediate data consistency versus eventual data accuracy in distributed systems.

8. Distributed Tracing
- Helps monitor and debug complex, distributed systems by tracking requests across multiple services.

9. Synchronous vs Asynchronous Communications
- Determines how systems interact, either waiting for responses (synchronous) or continuing independently (asynchronous).

10. Batch Processing vs Stream Processing
- Differentiates between processing large volumes of data at once (batch) and processing data in real-time (stream).

11. Fault Tolerance
- Ensures systems remain operational despite failures or errors.

P.S: I’ve been getting 10+ queries regarding DSA, HLD, and LLD daily

So, to answer all, I’ve launched my One Stop Resource guide for aspiring software engineers.

This guide help you with:
- full roadmap of DSA, HLD, and LLD for interviews
- good resources that I used included to save you time
- lots of problems and case studies for DSA and system design
